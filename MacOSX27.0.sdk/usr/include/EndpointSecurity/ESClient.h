 * @brief Suppress all events from the process described by the given `audit_token`
 *
 * @param client The client for which events will be suppressed
 * @param audit_token The audit token of the process for which events will be suppressed
 *
 * @return es_return_t indicating success or error
 *
 * @see es_mute_process_events
 *
 * @note The audit_token must refer to a currently running process. Muting a
 *       process that has already exited returns ES_RETURN_ERROR.
 * @note Muted processes are automatically unmuted when they exit.
 *
 * @note es_mute_process and es_mute_process_events install a rule for the
 *       process identified by audit_token. The rule applies in two roles: it
 *       matches an event when the specified process is the event's submitter
 *       (the process whose action produced the event), and it matches an event
 *       when the specified process is the event's instigator (the process that
 *       caused that action, present only on events that carry an instigator).
 *
 * @note Voting: Each role an event has (its submitter, and optionally an
 *       instigator) yields one vote. A role's vote (suppress, deliver, or
 *       abstain) is determined by the client's rule for the process filling
 *       that role; a role abstains when the client has no such rule (for
 *       example any process outside a descendants client's subtree). The event
 *       is suppressed if any role votes suppress; otherwise it is delivered if
 *       any role votes deliver; if every role abstains, the event is suppressed.
 *
 * @note Inversion: es_invert_muting(client, ES_MUTE_INVERSION_TYPE_PROCESS)
 *       toggles the client's process-mute inversion. It is an involution: any
 *       even number of toggles is a no-op and any odd number is equivalent to a
 *       single toggle. Each toggle exchanges the two non-abstaining votes for
 *       every process the client has a rule for - a suppress vote becomes
 *       deliver and a deliver vote becomes suppress. Abstain is self-dual: a
 *       role with no rule abstains regardless of inversion, and the
 *       all-abstain-is-suppressed rule above is unchanged. So under an odd
 *       number of inversions the processes named through es_mute_process /
 *       es_mute_process_events vote deliver, while every other
 *       process the client tracks votes suppress.
 *
 * @note Events that carry an instigator (so the instigator role can vote on
 *       them); every other event has only a submitter, so muting a process
 *       affects it only when that process is the submitter:
 *         - ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_SIGNAL / ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_SIGNAL
 *         - ES_EVENT_TYPE_AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_CHECK_IN / ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_BOOTSTRAP_CHECK_IN

 *         - ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_BTM_LAUNCH_ITEM_ADD / ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_BTM_LAUNCH_ITEM_REMOVE
 *         - the Open Directory events ES_EVENT_TYPE_NOTIFY_OD_GROUP_ADD,

 *           and _OD_DELETE_GROUP
 *       For all of these the instigator role is filled by the event's
 *       instigator field, with one exception: for the two AUTHORIZATION events
 *       the instigator role is the petitioner (the process that initiated the

 * @brief Invert the mute state of a given mute dimension
 *
 * @param client The es_client_t for which muting will be inverted
 * @param mute_type The type of muting to invert (process, path, or target path).
 *
 * @return es_return_t A value indicating whether or not muting was inverted
 *
 * @discussion Inverting muting can be used to create a client that monitors a specific process(es) or set of directories
 * When muting is inverted it still combines with other types of muting using OR, and inversion happens first.
 * Consider a series of inputs for a system where pid 12 is muted, process muting is inverted, and /bin/bash is also path muted:
 *   (12, /bin/foo)  MATCHING (true, false)  INVERSION (false, false) || false → event is not suppressed
 *   (13, /bin/foo)  MATCHING (false, false) INVERSION (true, false)  || true  → event is suppressed
 *   (12, /bin/bash) MATCHING (true, true)   INVERSION (false, true)  || true  → event is suppressed
 *
 *   Note that because muting is combined using OR even when pid 12 is being selected using inverted process muting,
 *   (12, /bin/bash) is still suppressed because the path is muted
 *
 * The relationship between all three types of muting (proc,path,target-path) and how each can be inverted is complex.
 * The below flow chart explains in detail exactly how muting is applied in the kernel:

 * @note Mute inversion does NOT clear the default mute set.
 * When a new `es_client_t` is created certain paths are muted by default.
 * This is known as "the default mute set".
 * The default mute set exists to protect ES clients from deadlocks, and to prevent watchdog timeout panics.
 * Creating a new client and calling `es_invert_muting(c, ES_MUTE_INVERSION_TYPE_PATH)` will result in the default mute set being
 * selected rather than muted. In most cases this is unintended. Consider calling `es_unmute_all_paths` before inverting process
 * path muting. Consider calling `es_unmute_all_target_paths` before inverting target path muting. Make sure the client has no
 * auth subscriptions before doing so. If desired the default mute set can be saved using `es_muted_paths_events` and then
 * restored after inverting again.

 * @param block The block that runs after all messages in front of the sync marker have been handled.
 * @discussion To best take advantage of this function it's important the caller understand the message queue invariants of an ES
 * client.
 *
 * When a program issues a syscall (or similar), it is guaranteed that before control is returned to the caller, the associated ES
 * message has been created and enqueued with all ES clients.
 * Message delivery is asynchronous (even for auth evnts), but enqueing is fully synchronous.
 * With that in mind, it makes it possible to write such code as:
 *
 * ```
 * dispatch_semaphore_t sema = dispatch_semaphore_create(0);
 * (void)open("/tmp/foo");
 * es_sync_client(client, ^(){ dispatch_semaphore_signal(sema); });
 * dispatch_semaphore_wait(sema, DISPATCH_TIME_FOREVER);
 * // At this point the open event for /tmp/foo has been delivered
 * ```
 * This is useful for any program that both has effects and subsribes to ES events.
 * `es_sync_client()` can tell you "When have all the events I am waiting for arrived?"
 *
 * Sync points are a more general concept with uses beyond this, for example if a caller unsubscribes from a certain event type,
 * they could then call `es_sync_client()`, and after the callback fires, know that all events of that type have now been
 * delivered.
 *
 * @note If the ES client is destroyed, all sync blocks are called.
 * @note This forces the current batch of messages to be flushed, the handler will be scheduled until the sync marker
 * is reached.
 * @note Can NOT be called from the ES handler block of `client`.
 * @note If client is null, the callback is immediately invoked and the function returns `ES_RETURN_SUCCESS`.

 *             The es_message_t is only guaranteed to live as long as the scope it is passed into.
 *             The memory for the given es_message_t is NOT owned by clients and it must not be freed.

 *
 * @note When a new client is initialized, there will be a set of paths and a subset of `es_event_type_t` events that are
 *       automatically muted by default. Generally, most AUTH event variants are muted but NOTIFY event variants will
 *       still be sent to the client. The set of paths muted by default are ones that can have an extremely negative impact to
 *       end users if their AUTH events are not allowed in a timely manner (for example, executable paths for processes
 *       that are monitored by the watchdogd daemon). It is important to understand that this list is *not* exhaustive and

 *       caution to limit user impact. The set of default muted paths and event types may change across macOS releases.
 *       It is possible to both inspect and unmute the set of default muted paths and associated event types using the
 *       appropriate mute-related API, however it is not recommended to unmute these items.
 *
 * @note The only supported way to check if an application is properly TCC authorized for Full Disk Access
 *       is to call es_new_client and handling ES_NEW_CLIENT_RESULT_ERR_NOT_PERMITTED in a way appropriate

 *       `x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.security?Privacy_AllFiles` (until macOS 12)
